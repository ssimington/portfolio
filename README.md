Telling Stories with Data Portfolio

# About Me
My name is Sarah Simington. I'm a 2nd year Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. After I graduate, I plan on pursuing a career in event management in the performing arts. In my spare time, I enjoy Broadway, brunch and baseball.

# What I Hope to Learn
In this class, I'm hoping to learn how to use different tools and resources to creatively illustrate empirical data in my future career. Having the skills to combine creativity and analytical thinking are extremely valuable in the arts, and I enjoy being able to combine the different parts of my personality into a project.
