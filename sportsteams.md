## Most Valuable Sports Teams in 2019
I found [this graphic](https://howmuch.net/articles/worlds-most-valuable-sport-teams) of Forbes' [50 Most Valuable Sports Teams in 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/07/22/the-worlds-50-most-valuable-sports-teams-2019/#26ebfab4283d). While this is not necessarily a bad data visualization, there were a few things that I thought could be improved. First of all, I did not realize initially that the different shades of blue were representative of different value levels. I didn't see the key or even notice the color coding until I had been studying the chart for a while. Second, for being published on a financial website, the chart didn't highlight the value of the teams as much as one would think. Third, while I do like being able to see the breakdown by sports league (soccer, NFL, MLB, NBA), I would prefer to see the full data in order and then color code by sports league.

I began my process my sketching out a new version of this chart.

2. A couple paragraphs describing what your process was.  You should include a few insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering a redesign, if anything.  You should talk about how you moved next to the wireframes, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  If it led you to change anything about your data visualization's design, mention what that was.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently. 

You can also include screenshots of your wireframes or other artifacts with your narrative if it helps tell the story of how you moved through the process. 

3.  Your final data visualization!
